## Changelog

### New Features

- New Repeat Text Feature:
    - This feature allows us to repeat the last texts spoken by the mod.
    - We can use the `Left/Right Alt + Space` to speak the very last text.
        - And when pressed again within 500 ms, it will repeat the second last text, then the third text and so on.
        - This is configurable and named "RepeatLastTextKey" in the config.
    - We can also the `rlt` (short for repeat last text) command to do the same.
        - The commands syntax is `rlt <index>`
        - Replace <index> with the number, 1 representing the last text, 2 the second last and so on.
- Mod commands can be entered through chat (this does not require the chat commands mod like before).
- The bobber machine is patched although the style names are arbitrary for now (Waiting for @ParadoxiKat and JJ to make them more descriptive ðŸ™‚)
